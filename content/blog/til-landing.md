**Today I Learned** will be an ongoing series where I detail how I solved some technical problems. The real audience is myself in the future, and maybe some of these fixes I found can be helpful for others.

I will try to give examples in the post about code problems. I will leverage Github Gist if the examples are longer than a few lines.

Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions with [Github Issues](https://github.com/hammacktony/website/issues).
